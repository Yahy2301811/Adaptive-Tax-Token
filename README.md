# Adaptive-Tax-Token
An experimental ERC20 token implementing adaptive tokenomics through an auto-adjusting transfer tax. The contract monitors recent transfer volume in a configurable time window and dynamically increases or decreases fees based on market activity. A clean, dependency-free demonstration of self-regulating, volume-responsive economic design.
